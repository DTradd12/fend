## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Basic Information About the Project

### Description
This project takes the sections from the HTML, and through JavaScript, dynamically creates a navigation bar, that when clicked, will appropriately navigate to the corresponding section on the page.

The project also will show which section is "active" on the navbar and will automatically highlight itself when a section is in full-view within the window.

### Instructions
The HTML holds the base information for the page, and links to a seperate javascript file, file path: /js/app.js.
There is no javascript within the HTML file.

The CSS file is for styling, and has been setup to be responsive to different device sizes.
