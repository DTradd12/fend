# Landing Page Project

## Basic Information About the Project

### Description
This project takes the sections from the HTML, and through JavaScript, dynamically creates a navigation bar, that when clicked, will appropriately navigate to the corresponding section on the page.

The project also will show which section is "active" on the navbar and will automatically highlight itself when a section is in full-view within the window.

### Instructions
The HTML holds the base information for the page, and links to a separate javascript file, file path: /js/app.js.
There is no javascript within the HTML file.

The CSS file is for styling, and has been setup to be responsive to different device sizes.
